**[`top`](#understanding-top-command)** is a monitoring program which is used frequently for tracking process's resource usage and its activity in **real-time**, show current tasks being serviced by the kernel, help **discovering** and **diagnosing** overload or capacity of system by seeing **CPU & Mem usage**. It's available under many Unix/Linux operating systems.

<!--description-->

## Description from man page:
The top program provides a dynamic real-time view of a running system. It can display system summary information as well as a list of processes or threads currently being managed by the Linux kernel. The types of system summary information shown and the types order and size of information displayed for processes are all user configurable and that configuration can be  made persistent across restarts.

The program provides a limited interactive interface for process manipulation as well as a much more extensive interface for personal configuration - encompassing every aspect of its operation. And while top is referred to throughout this document, you are free to name the program anything you wish. That new name, possibly an alias, will then be reflected on top's display and used when reading and writing a configuration file. ...

### 1. Date and uptime
Current time is **13:41**, and system has been running for over **5 weeks**, from last boot on **May 17**
```
top - 13:41:31 up 38 days, 21:04,  3 users,  load average: 0.01, 0.09, 0.13
‚ùØ‚ùØ date
Sun Jun 25 13:41:31 UTC 2017
‚ùØ‚ùØ uptime
13:41:31 up 38 days, 21:04,  3 users,  load average: 0.01, 0.09, 0.13
‚ùØ‚ùØ uptime -p
up 5 weeks, 3 days, 21 hours, 6 minutes
‚ùØ‚ùØ uptime -s

```

### 2. Number of logged users
I have 3 logged users and what they are doing:
- one is running ssh to other
- one is on bash shell
- and ... me with `w` command

```
3 users
‚ùØ‚ùØ w
 13:41:31 up 38 days, 21:04,  3 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05

ubuntu   pts/6    x.161.x.xxx      13:47    3.00s  0.04s  0.00s w
```

### 3. Load average
The **`load average`** is a number corresponding to the average number of **runnable processes** on the system. The load average is often listed as three sets of numbers, which represent the load average for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes. - from [RedHat](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/4/html/Introduction_To_System_Administration/s2-bandwidth-rhlspec-cpu.html)

On Linux systems, these numbers include **processes wanting to run on CPU**, as well as processes blocked in uninterruptible I/O (usually disk I/O). This gives a high level idea of **resource load** (or demand). The three numbers give us some idea of **how load is changing over time**. For example, if you‚Äôve been asked to check a problem server, and the 1 minute value is much lower than the 15 minute value, then you might have logged in too late and missed the issue - from [Netfilx Techblog](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/linux-performance-analysis-in-60-000-milliseconds-accc10403c55)

**`Runable processes`** means: running and blocked processes (usually by I/O). That's really important because it means that you can have `0% CPU usage` and still have `high load`. The processes blocked on I/O show up in the "**D**" state in `ps`, header "STAT" or "S"

Lower numbers are better than higher numbers. If the third number is **too high** (15 minutes ago), I think we got a problem about the performance to deal with. But what's the **`Threshold`**, what's too high. We need a reasonable and **acceptable value** for comparison.

#### 3.1 Single logical CPU
**In general**, with `one logical CPU` - 1 vCPU, **`Threshold = 0.7`** is a best practice, many sysadmins will draw a line at 0.70.

For example in case of 1 vCPU: 
```
load average: 1.25, 0.60, 4.20
```
- over the last 1 minute: System was overloaded by `25% on average`. 0.25 processes were waiting for the CPU
- over the last 5 minutes: CPU `idled for 40%` of the time. **It's acceptable**
- over the last 15 minutes: System was `overloaded by 320%` on average. 3.20 processes were waiting for the CPU.

#### 3.2  Multi-logical CPUs
With 4 logical CPUs system? It's still healthy with a load of 2.80 - 3.00. On multi-logical CPUs system, the load is relative to the number of vCPUs available. 

The "100% utilization" mark is 1.00 on a single-logical CPU system, 2.00, on a dual vCPUs, 4.00 on a quad-vCPUs, etc.

In `top` command, press `1` for each vCPU is displayed seperately, also to know number of vCPU.
I have 4 vCPUs in this case, using EC2 AWS C4 type, low load average
```
top - 09:10:00 up 32 days, 6 min,  2 users,  load average: 0.01, 0.04, 0.05
Tasks: 125 total,   1 running, 124 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
%Cpu0  :  0.7 us,  0.0 sy,  0.0 ni, 99.3 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st
%Cpu1  :  0.0 us,  0.3 sy,  0.0 ni, 99.7 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st
%Cpu2  :  0.0 us,  0.0 sy,  0.0 ni,100.0 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st
%Cpu3  :  5.0 us,  0.3 sy,  0.0 ni, 94.6 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st
```

### 4. Process/Thread state
Let's focus on **Area1** in that [overview picture]({% post_url 2017-07-16-Understanding-top-command %}#understanding-top-command) above. In that top area, `top` shows the total number of processes and how many of them are running. But it says **Tasks** not **Processes**. Because another name for a process is a task. The Linux kernel internally refers to processes as tasks.
```
Tasks: 283 total,   1 running, 282 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
```
From the time a process is born to when it is terminated, the process proceeds through various states. Those states can include **Runnable**, **Running**, **Sleeping** (in memory and on disk), and **Zombie** states - from [Redhat](https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/attachments/processstates_20120831.pdf)

![](/assets/img/process-state.webp "Process state life cycle")

#### 4.1 Runable state
When a process is in a Runnable state, it means it has all the resources it needs to run, except that the CPU
is not available. 

For example: A process is dealing with I/O, so it does not immediately need the CPU,  when the process finishes the I/O operation, a signal is generated to the CPU and the scheduler keeps that process in the run queue (the list of ready-to-run processes maintained by the kernel) - **Runable**. When the CPU is available, this process will enter into **Running** state

#### 4.2 Running state
The process that is executing and using the CPU at a particular moment is called a **Running** process.

A CPU can execute either in kernel mode (sy) or in user mode (us). When a user initiates a process, the process starts working in user mode. That user mode process does not have access to kernel data structures or algorithms. Each CPU type provides special instructions to switch from user mode to kernel mode - they're **system calls**

**System calls**: communication chanel between user space program and kernel


#### 4.3 Sleeping state
A process enters a **Sleeping** state when it needs resources that are not currently available. At that point, it either goes voluntarily into Sleep state or the kernel puts it into Sleep state. Going into Sleep state means the process immediately gives up its access to the CPU.

When the resource the process is waiting on becomes available, a signal is sent to the CPU. The next time the scheduler gets a chance to schedule this sleeping process, the scheduler will put the process either in Running or Runnable state

#### 4.4 Terminated/Stopped state
Processes can end when they call the exit system themselves or receive signals to end. We use `kill -9 <PID>` to kill a process.

See more at [Signals](https://github.com/hieuhtr/Blog/blob/master/2017/Signal-of-Linux.md)

#### 4.5 Zombie state
When a process dies on Linux, it isn‚Äôt all removed from memory immediately ‚Äî its process descriptor stays in memory (the process descriptor only takes a tiny amount of memory). The process‚Äôs status becomes `EXIT_ZOMBIE` and the process‚Äôs parent is notified that its child process has died with the `SIGCHLD` signal. The parent process is then supposed to execute the `wait()` system call to read the dead process‚Äôs exit status and other information. This allows the parent process to get information from the dead process. After `wait()` is called, the zombie process is completely removed from memory.

This normally happens very quickly, so you won‚Äôt see zombie processes accumulating on your system. However, if a parent process isn‚Äôt programmed properly and never calls wait(), its zombie children will stick around in memory until they‚Äôre cleaned up. - from [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/119815/htg-explains-what-is-a-zombie-process-on-linux/)

Zombies that exist for more than a short period of time typically indicate a bug in the parent program, or just an uncommon decision to not reap children (see example). If the parent program is no longer running, zombie processes typically indicate a bug in the operating system. - from [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_process)

Here are the different values that the s, stat and state output specifiers (header "STAT" or "S") will display to describe the state of a process:

- D:    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
- R:    running or runnable (on run queue)
- S:    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
- T:    stopped by job control signal
- t:    stopped by debugger during the tracing
- W:    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
- X:    dead (should never be seen)
- Z:    defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent

See state of all processes by using `ps -el` command.
