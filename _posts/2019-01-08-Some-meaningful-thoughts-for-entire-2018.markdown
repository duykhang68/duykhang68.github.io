description: all about learned mindsets, improvement technique and thinking
---

This is a post for reminding these learned points, thinkings, ideas, mindsets about how to do and live better in 2018, only for myself. I logged because I scare that I will forget and go wrong or do the same mistake ever and ever again.

* Time is a **fixed** and the most important resource, if taking care too much about non-sense things, **will have no time** for really right and important things in your life.
* Run, think and **improve continuously whatever**, even small/big things everyday. Live today in the same state as yesterday does not mean the same, it means **lagging behind others**.
* Write down, well documented, or take note on somewhere because of **forgetting process** in the human brain, but make sure **never forget mindsets** and **core thinking techniques** (like critical thinking, SWOT analysis,...). Details can forget, but cores must be in brain, seriously.
* Must know **why you do what you do?**
* Should have private time for yourself (every week), no smartphone, no laptop, no people, just you and think about the past week or doing meditation for training attention and awareness, achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm state.

## There are only 2 basic types of action:
* One: you can totally control this.
* Two: you be forced to do regardless of you hate or refuse to do, don't care, let them come then let them go.

I want to note and share about **the first one**. So you can control actions, think about:
* Making decision for doing the right thing at right time for **gaining highest value**.
* Focus on working scoped things during 8hrs working day, only for increasing quality of your company products, **ignore non-sense things** (including fuckers and dirty ones, **who the fuck cares**) 
* Do one thing, get it done first (minimum viable), take a rest then get back to work on improvement, check every case, every reason. **DROP OTHERS**
* Don't fucking any care about trash, shitty, fuckers, stupid, nonsense, not related to you. **IGNORE.IGNORE.IGNORE.** is the key. 
* I repeat: Time is a fixed and the most important resource, if taking care too much about non-sense things, will have no time for really right and important things in your life.

**It's all about trade-offs and makes the right decisions.**
