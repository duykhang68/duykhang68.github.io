**`top`** command is a performance monitoring program which is used frequently to monitor processor activity in **real-time**, current tasks being serviced by the kernel, help **discovering** and **diagnosing** problems in **CPU** and **memory usage**. It's available under many Unix/Linux operating systems.

## Description from man page:

The top program provides a dynamic real-time view of a running system. It can display system summary information as well as a list of processes or threads currently being managed by the Linux kernel. The types of system summary information shown and the types order and size of information displayed for processes are all user configurable and that configuration can be  made persistent across restarts.

The program provides a limited interactive interface for process manipulation as well as a much more extensive interface for personal configuration - encompassing every aspect of its operation. And while top is referred to throughout this document, you are free to name the program anything you wish. That new name, possibly an alias, will then be reflected on top's display and used when reading and writing a configuration file.
