description: How to pull myself together and take control over anxiety

The fucking COVID-19 crisis is trutly terrifying. Hypotheticals from scary movies, fiction books, white papers become reality. It's not Wuhan localized outbreaks anymore. Global spread of virus is accelerating rapidly according to WHO. It's real and it means: "The game is on".

I think everyone has their own depressive thinkings. Panic-buying and stockpiling basic necessities because of worry and scare. Act is a part of automatic reflection and it makes sense. I think we should know that it's okay to have anxiety, it should be accepted. **Please don't deride these panic actions**, if you criticize, you are fuckers and dumb.

But during these days, somehow I feel that I have many difference prospective thinkings when facing latest news and it's changing day by day. Turning 180 degree in my fucking head make me stressful and decreasing productivity. To be honest, I cannot do or produce any good outputs since the first reported case in Vietnam. I afraid that I will burnout soon. So that it's why I'm trying to rethinking to keep myself persistency, and now I'm writing down to keep it.

<!--description-->

From my point of view, persistent thinkings can be defined in three parts: one is my own rules, one is about realistic, one is about expectation and ...optimism.

## 1. THE RULES

Pandemic is unpredictable, but at least I can prepare for what I can do & control:
- Family first, make calls daily as posible. It would be good when knowing mom, dad and everyone is ok. There is nothing important than family during these sensitive time.
- Keeping up the news is ok, but 2 times/day is good enough: **11:00 AM** & **8:00 PM**. There is no reason to check it reguraly hour by hour. Having tons of information is not useful as I assumed that should be.
- Self-quarantines at home and follow social distancing are must do.
- After going out for necessities -> do handwashing + mouthwashsing + <a style="color:red;">**wash my fucking throat**</a> (súc họng)
- Best time to take multivitamin may be in the morning. It's an attempt to boost immune system.

I'm assuming that I can do these things as above without asking and concerning then I can free my mind from worries, keep my mind clear for focusing small but useful things like:
- Learning how to mediate
- Learning about power of market supply and demand, consumer behavior, learn stock investment
- 

## 2. THE REALISTIC

## 3. THE EXPECTATION & OPTIMISM
