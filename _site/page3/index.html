            <p>
              <p><strong>Let’s define productivity</strong>. Productivity is a measure of efficiency of a person completing a task. We often assume that productivity means getting more things done each day. Wrong. Productivity is getting important things done consistently. And no matter what you are working on, there are only a <code class="highlighter-rouge">few things</code> that are <code class="highlighter-rouge">truly important</code>. Being productive is about maintaining a steady, average speed on a few things, not maximum speed on everything.</p>

<h3 id="warren-buffetts-2-list-strategy-for-focused-attention">Warren Buffett’s “2 List” Strategy for Focused Attention</h3>
<p>Buffett uses a simple 3-step productivity strategy to help his employees determine their priorities and actions. You may find this method useful for making decisions and getting yourself to commit to doing one thing right away</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Write down your top <code class="highlighter-rouge">25 career goals</code>. Or you could also complete this exercise with goals for a shorter timeline. For example, write down the top 25 things you want to <code class="highlighter-rouge">accomplish this week</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Review this list and circle top <strong>5 goals</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Start working on top 5 goals right away. Everything in 20 things that you didn’t circle just became your avoid-At-All-Cost list.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No matter what, these things get no attention from you until you’ve succeeded with your top 5</p>
</blockquote>

              <blockquote>
  <p>behavior will become part of you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We get what we invest in. The time we spend comes back, with interest.</p>

<p>If you practice five minutes of new, difficult banjo music <code class="highlighter-rouge">every day</code>, you’ll become a <code class="highlighter-rouge">better</code> banjo player. If you spend a little bit more time each day <code class="highlighter-rouge">whining</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">feeling ashamed</code>, that behavior will become part of you. The words you type, the people you hang with, the media you consume</p>

<p>The difference between who you are now and who you were five years ago is largely due to how you’ve spent your time along the way.</p>

<p>The habits we groove become who we are, one minute at a time.</p>

              <h3 id="why-we-need-patching-linux-kernel">Why we need patching linux kernel?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Kernel patches are released for a number of reasons, but fixing security holes is the most frequent reason. This is why it’s important to install the patch as soon as possible.</li>
  <li>Unlike other operating systems, Linux is able to update many different parts of the system without a reboot, but the kernel is different. Every running process integrates with the kernel intimately, so switching out parts of the kernel while it is running is quite risky. So, When the kernel is updated via a patch, the system needs to <code class="highlighter-rouge">reboot</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="no-reboot-kernel-patching">“No Reboot” Kernel patching</h3>
<ul>
  <li>On the other hand, rebooting the computer is irksome, and in some cases, where uptime is important, it can be a real issue. This is why “no reboot” kernel patching has been a priority for many administrators.</li>
  <li>Some servers and critical real-time applications must not be taken down without advanced scheduling, even for a few minutes. This can be a pain when administrators need to keep the system secure and a patch is released to repair a newly discovered security hole. In this case, no-reboot patching becomes a real boon</li>
  <li>Recognizing this need, <strong>Red Hat</strong> has been working on <code class="highlighter-rouge">kpatch</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">SUSE</code> has been working on <code class="highlighter-rouge">kGraft</code>. Both of these programs are designed to accomplish the same task, but they take a different approach and have different strengths.</li>
  <li>But this doesn’t mean that system reboots are gone forever. Even on a system with the Linux 4.0 kernel, there will be security updates that still require a reboot, because there are other non-kernel components that can require patching, and some of these require a reboot as part of the process.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>DNS stands for Domain Name System</li>
  <li>Its purpose is to resolve and translate human-readable website name to IPv4 or IPv6 address</li>
  <li>It’s basically a large Database which resides on various servers around the world, that contains the names and IP address of various host/domains.</li>
  <li>Without DNS, we would only be able to visit any website directly via IP address, no human-readable anymore</li>
  <li>DNS works on both the TCP and UDP Protocols, <strong>port 53</strong></li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: DNS cache on Chrome</p>
<ul>
  <li>TODO: DNS query on chrome’s cache, see <code class="highlighter-rouge">chrome://net-internals/#dns</code></li>
  <li>True: Return IP address of this domain for making a request</li>
  <li>False: Didn’t know it before –&gt; call OS (step3)</li>
