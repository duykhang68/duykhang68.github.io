    <p>I’m obsessed with keeping infrastructure up and finding better ways for commitments. My mental health turns bad because of seeing fucking services/ops that <strong>were built &amp; done carelessly</strong> without any sufficiently exhausting efforts <strong>including myself</strong>. I don’t care about what others think, about why they do what they do. <strong>I’m serious</strong>. Because… well, it belongs to them, no need to take my efforts for understanding it. In the end, <strong>the most important is final outcome</strong>: Is it good enough? Is it the right thing at the right time? How about quality? How about HA &amp; scalable? Is it secure? and so on.</p>

<p>In Devops/SRE scope, trying to adapt incoming tasks, solve problems by providing commonplace solution is…easy, it’s get-shit-done inattentively, something is workaround, temporary. Yes, it’s <strong>EASY THINGS</strong>, come with useless, low impact also very breakable. Well… at some points in my work-life, I realize that issues are not from the context, not from others. <a style="color:red;">Mostly issues are from me</a>, from my bad habits, bad thingking, bad mindsets. It makes me feel <strong>shutting down</strong>, <strong>dumb</strong>, <strong>fucked-up</strong> also with <strong>getting lost</strong>.</p>

<p>So…</p>
<ul>
  <li><a style="color:red;"><strong>AM I UNRELIABLE?</strong></a></li>
  <li>what’s common failures that I was facing?</li>
  <li>how can I make myself <strong>not to go down the wrong path</strong>?</li>
  <li>and how can I avoid stumbling blocks and feel better?</li>

<!--description-->

<p>So, here are some common failures of myself, I think that if I can describe so that maybe I can have a better version of myself.</p>

<h2 id="1-read-the-fucking-manual-rtfm">1. <strong>READ THE FUCKING MANUAL RTFM</strong></h2>
<p>Cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>cannot solve issues, cannot understand what’s going on at this infra component</li>
  <li>stuck with ambiguous logs, cannot finding rootcause, only do dirty workarounds…</li>
</ul>

<p>Stuck &amp; feel tired <strong>because having nothing to do next</strong>. The common sense is when arriving at home, out of business hours, I still spend my time to continue investigating. <strong>Kind of pointless works</strong>. It’s hard to say how can I survive, but I can confirm that mostly it’s because of not spending time for reading documents. Instead of continue working &amp; step towards the unknown, I re-audit myself and found some important things:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Docs are not written for fun</strong>. It’s all about knowledge &amp; guidelines.</li>
  <li>Lack of knowledge and information will lead to nowhere.</li>
  <li>Spend time for <strong>reading docs attentively</strong> is a must, for understanding all things clearly.</li>
  <li>Don’t wait for collecting knowledge until facing issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>A strong knowledge base for making decisions is always better than unreasonable assumption.</p>

<h2 id="2-no-rushing">2. <strong>NO RUSHING</strong></h2>

<p>The case is after spending one working week entirely for a task with high sense of concentration, assume that my commitments will be good, mostly finish before the fucking deadline, ready for deploying &amp; delivering to end-user, then… <strong>everything after that is nonreliable</strong>, unexpected, breakable and not important anymore. <strong>Outcome = Zero</strong>. Why? Why the fuck changes &amp; happens? No, everything is fine, everything is normal and on track with persistency requirements. Issue here is <strong>not clearly knowing goal</strong> from the outset, because of <strong>jumping to working immediately without any WHY</strong>, without any concerns:</p>
<ul>
  <li>without any self-researching and wonder why do I need it?</li>
  <li>Why do I need to build it in that way, do I have any better ways?</li>
  <li>Do I know exactly what they really want? (product owner, customers, end-user)</li>
  <li>Does my solution fit with end-user problem?</li>
  <li>Does my solution speed $$ less than the budget or overestimating?</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes <strong>just do it</strong> is common sense, it’s not wrong, because somehow I cannot spend time for understanding before doing. But not everything needs to be done immediately, no rushing. More multi-dimensional perspective could make a positive impact and lead to the right implementation, it seems to be better.</p>

<h2 id="3-focus-on-fancy-job-titles">3. <strong>FOCUS ON FANCY JOB TITLES</strong></h2>

<p>I was impressed by engineers with <strong>fancy</strong> title, something like: waooo, he’s too young but having senior levels, how can I <strong>do like this</strong>? Looking at senior teammates, this kind of question always stuck in my mind for suck a long time, how can I reach to principal level, How can I write and share technical docs/blog-posts that having extremely deep &amp; intense knowledge, How can I have such reputations on stackoverflow as his own, in many times, I consoled myself that because of senior/principal titles.</p>

<p>The truth is: concern, wonder and set goal to reach to higher levels is suck. Consoling is suck too. <strong>If nothing changes, nothing changes</strong>. Thinking too much is mostly a waste of time. By start working on solving hard problems that I scared before, by taking effort to solve unanswered questions or providing better answers on SO, I feel more energetic and well… at least I did something instead of always asking. It all begins with that first stepping up.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/so-reputation.png" alt="img" title="Stackoverflow Reputation" /></p>

<p>From the other side, otherwise, collecting a ton of metrics on worloads from engineer is <strong>good for management board</strong>. It supports us to have a clear and fair making decision on separating levels of Devops/SRE engineer, for adapting and building structures of benefit also with responsibility. Increasing level means <strong>increasing salary/benefit</strong> based on logged metrics &amp; achievements are totally make sense. It’s fine. I do not disagree 100% about evaluation, because recently by having a chance to work on Devops/SRE evaluation report, I found it really useful to determine the situation, to know what I really need to achieve higher level. But so far, it’s only a checklist, a reference after all.</p>

<h2 id="4-stick-in-the-mud">4. <strong>STICK-IN-THE-MUD</strong></h2>
<p>My real cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>stick with handling AWS on web console clicking, using only EC2 <code class="highlighter-rouge">t2.xxxx</code> type <strong>for years</strong></li>
  <li>solve perf issues on linux with <strong>fixed viewpoint</strong>, follow up with templated steps. Feel great when receiving outputs <strong>as expected</strong>. Kind of <strong>micro skilled works</strong>, thanks for practicing &amp; developing during a long time.</li>
  <li>bring experiences on old environment/company, <strong>apply for new place</strong>.</li>
  <li>apply <strong>learned techniques</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>on <code class="highlighter-rouge">BAREMETAL-base</code> for <code class="highlighter-rouge">VM-based</code></li>
      <li>on <code class="highlighter-rouge">VM-based</code> for <code class="highlighter-rouge">CONTAINER-based</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>determine that there is <strong>nothing to do</strong> with this infrastructure this week, because <strong>don’t know what to do next</strong>, or already did anything.</li>
  <li>… and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m the guy who did all cases as above, <strong>sometimes I feel proud of myself</strong>, not because of any success I’ve achieved, but because I can <strong>see myself growing up</strong>, learn, practice and then apply. OK. Nothing wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.” – Alvin Toffler</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The truth is feeling good on micro skilled works is suck. There is always something needs to do, <strong>there is always a better way of doing things</strong>, for enhancing, improving. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nokia-ceo-ended-his-speech-saying-we-didnt-do-anything-rahul-gupta/">Like Nokia</a>: “we didn’t do anything wrong, but somehow, we lost”. Live today in the same state as yesterday does not mean the same, it means lagging behind others. Because <strong>nothing can take the place of persistence</strong>. Any good thing can be wrong in different situations, not suitable anymore.</p>

<p>The hard thing right here is not about learning, it’s about how to detect &amp; know <strong>what can be unlearned</strong>, what can be re-thinking, <strong>rework</strong>. Cannot unlearn, struggle with change, difficult to adapt will lead to fucked up. The world is descending into chaos.</p>

<p><strong>Solutions (hard-to-do)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>when having a chance to add more steps on the old deployment that was built for 6 months ago ==&gt; work on adding new steps first ==&gt; <strong>audit entire flow</strong> ==&gt; then adding some <strong>refactoring instead of leaving it</strong>.</li>
  <li>when operating an existing infra, the goal is not only cover the uptime of this but also <strong>cover &amp; collect feedback/disadvantage to make it evolve</strong>.</li>
  <li>… and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>==&gt; <strong>Utilizing</strong> every chance, every opportunity for <strong>seeking new challenges</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="5-fearfulness">5. <strong>FEARFULNESS</strong></h2>
<p>I know reading docs is good for myself, expand my knowledge base. I know that seeking challenges will help me grow up. I know that doing hard things will achieving high output &amp; have big impact, but somehow I still refuse to do. <strong>I know, but I don’t do.</strong></p>

<p>There is always a reason behind everything:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not everything is necessary [tentatively accept]
    <ul>
      <li>Out of scope, just don’t care, stop putting efforts, ask talents when needed.</li>
      <li>Closely related, but priority &amp; situation define what &amp; when I will spend time reading &amp; learning.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Laziness, idleness from myself. FML. I have no solution at this time. [tentatively accept]</li>
  <li><a style="color:red;"><strong>Fucking fearfulness</strong></a>
    <ul>
      <li>fear of doing hard things, afraid of hard stuff, fear because that technical point is too hard to learn</li>
      <li>fear because it’s edge case, fear &amp; <a href="/technical/whatthefuck/mindset/2019/12/14/Site-nonReliable-engineering.html#4-stick-in-the-mud">struggle with changes</a></li>
      <li>fear when working with legacy/unknow things, fear of doing it wrong, making mistakes, fear of receiving bad feedbacks from others</li>
      <li>feel scared of being not good enough for new challenges, new upcoming things</li>
      <li>…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To be honest, fear is my close friend. Sometimes, I surprise myself that I fear more things than I think.
So how can I survive?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Until <strong>there is nobody for delegating</strong> anymore. It’s becoming a <strong>must thing</strong> to do. <strong>No one can help me</strong> do this anymore, I need to do this by myself.</li>
  <li>Until I found <a style="color:red;"><strong>myself unable to accept fucking myself</strong></a> anymore. I feel sad because I missed many good opportunities to make it happens. Set goals 3 months ago, but have done nothing. Because I <strong>realize that I cannot wait</strong>, cannot ignore hard things anymore.</li>
  <li>Until I’m in the zone. <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=In%20The%20Zone">In the zone</a> means implies increased focus and attention which allow for higher levels of performance, your potential becomes more than what it is and anything around you becomes phased out seemingly a place where you can’t be stopped or touched. <a href="/mindset/2017/03/12/habit-time-management.html">Work more when you’re in the zone</a>. Relax when you’re not. By utilizing in the zone, <a style="color:green;"><strong>“eager” is something more than “fear”</strong></a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h2>

<p>There’s nothing new under the sun.</p>

<p>But I still wanna audit &amp; write for myself, not about nothing new, it’s about I wanna come to the end of the road of myself to see what it is.</p>
